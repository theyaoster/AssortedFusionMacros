# AssortedFusionMacros
A collection of macros I wrote that I personally find useful. They have been tested in Davinci Resolve's port of Fusion in versions 15+. Please submit an issue if any are broken in future releases of Davinci Resolve or Fusion. I have not tested these in the standalone Fusion as I do not own it.

See the wiki for documentation on specific macros.
